<p>Daniel Anderson, Univ. of North Carolina, Chapel Hill</p>

<p>This presentation explores how digital tools—particularly tools for versioning documents and capturing media—can help address the challenges of performing critique in the humanities. As Rita Felski notes, contemporary models of critique feature “suspicious reading" that engenders distrustful attitudes toward texts and a host of damaging side effects ranging from aggression to a sense of objective superiority to unexamined methodologies that border on the banal. Felski, Judith Butler, Timothy Bewes, and others suggest that alternative approaches can translate into modes of critique that evoke a generous and creative reading subject. The presentation takes up two case studies—a poem and a scholarly article—to further examine the roles of digital tools in such an expanded, generative model of critique. Looking at multiple artifacts from the composing of the scholarly piece and the use of mixed (analog and digital) screens in a “reading” of the poem, the presentation calls for (and enacts) deploying digital tools to develop modes of creative scholarly response.</p>

<p>Sustainability remains the elephant in the room with respect to digital scholarly resources. This contribution will reflect on sustainability challenges in relation to a longer-lived large-scale DH project’s past and prospective strategies, situating them against current thinking on the topic. The Orlando Project has just celebrated the 20th anniversary of its inception as an experiment in digital literary history, and is approaching the 10th anniversary of its publication, since which time it has expanded its content by 45%. This has been achieved in the absence of any dedicated funding stream for sustaining project activities following the initial 5 years, and in a context in which publishing revenues cover only a fraction of the costs. This contribution will canvas the various factors and forms of support that have contributed to maintenance of the project, from institutional university support, contributions from the publisher, and forms of grant funding. Given that research grants could not sustain the project, Orlando was fortunate to be able to turn to a Canadian program for funding research infrastructure. This allowed the project both to renew and generalize its back-end production system in order to sustain Orlando alongside other digital projects. This new infrastructure, the Canadian Writing Research Collaboratory (CWRC), will support networked research on scales ranging from the individual to the large team, and will contribute to the sustainability of the projects it houses in various ways. CWRC will allow Orlando to adopt a less centralized model of scholarly production, which demands a new leadership structure and a new kind of relationship with our scholarly community. The presentation will outline this model, describing the challenges of moving from a quite centralized to a community-based model of production, and soliciting feedback on how to sustain such projects within the changing landscapes of digital and feminist literary scholarship.</p>
